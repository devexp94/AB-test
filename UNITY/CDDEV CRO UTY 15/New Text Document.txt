When a user activates the experiment...

The user will see social proof related headers on each PLP. This should sit below the standard H1 of each page, and above the blurb content where applicable
For the /3D and /2D category pages, the copy should be as follows:  Join thousands of other creators in building {category} projects
For the other main category pages, the copy should be as follows: Find the perfect {category} asset to build your project
For all sub categories and search categories, the copy should be as follows:
-  Join thousands of other creators in building amazing projects
For pages such as https://assetstore.unity.com/3d/characters there already exists a subheader short paragraph. In these scenarios NEW social header should be placed between 3D Characters and the supporting copy, e.g. “Populate your gaming project with our collection”
